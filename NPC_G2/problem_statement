# Task Create a Custom Market Making strategy on HummingBot

Design and develop a custom Python script for pure market-making for a Centralized crypto exchange(CEX) . The script will run on an [orderbook](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/learn/advanced-trading/what-is-an-order-book) within the  Hummingbot framework and should incorporate  volatility indicators, trend analysis, and risk framework for managing  for inventory. Your task is to create a market-making script that combines these indicators with proper risk management practices while showcasing your own thought process and creativity.

First, review the resources below to understand how Hummingbot works. Study the demo Pure Market Making (PMM) script, then use the available parameters to complete the assignment.

Hummingbot is an open-source Python framework that helps you run automated trading strategies on a  CEX. It includes a demo pure market-making strategy, which you can learn about in these resources: https://hummingbot.org/strategies/pure-market-making/ and https://hummingbot.org/strategy-configs/#list-of-configs. Your task it to take the PMM algorithm and improve upon the algorithm by incorporating volatility, trend analysis and risk framework.
