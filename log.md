# Implementation Log

## April 6, 2025 - Initial Implementation
- Created precision_trading_strategy.py
- Implemented Precision Trading Strategy with:
  - Volatility indicators (ATR, Bollinger Bands)
  - Trend analysis (EMA, MACD, RSI)
  - Multi-timeframe confirmation
  - Adaptive spread calculation
  - Risk management framework
  - Market regime detection

## April 6, 2025 - Troubleshooting and Improvements

### Issues Encountered

1. **Path Handling Errors**
   - Error: `"unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'PosixPath' and 'NoneType'"`
   - Root cause: Incorrect file path handling when trying to load configuration files
   - Impact: Unable to load configurations properly for the trading strategy

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   - Error: `"Error getting server time. Check network connection."`
   - Root cause: Problems establishing connection with exchange servers
   - Impact: Strategy couldn't connect to exchange for price data and order placement

3. **API Rate Limit Warnings**
   - Warning: `"API rate limit on /public/get_all_instruments (5 calls per 1s) has almost reached"`
   - Root cause: Too many API calls being made in a short period of time
   - Impact: Risk of being temporarily blocked by the exchange API

4. **Configuration File Loading**
   - Issue: Configuration files weren't being properly recognized by Hummingbot
   - Root cause: Non-standard naming convention and location of config files
   - Impact: Unable to import and use configuration templates

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Created Simplified Strategy Version**
   - Implemented a simplified version (precision_trading_simple.py) for testing
   - Removed complex features to isolate potential issues
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **Improved Configuration Handling**
   - Created properly named configuration files:
     - `conf_simple_precision_trading.yml` in scripts directory
     - Same file in standard location: `conf/strategies/`
   - Updated scripts to check multiple locations for configuration files
   - Added fallback to default parameters when config files can't be found

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Added detailed logging to file for easier troubleshooting
   - Documented known issues and solutions in configuration files
   - Added both console and log file output for important events

4. **Fixed Path Handling**
   - Implemented robust path handling using os.path functions
   - Added existence checks before attempting to open files
   - Provided clear error messages for path-related issues

5. **Configuration File Structure**
   - Added comments explaining parameters
   - Documented common errors and their solutions
   - Followed Hummingbot naming convention (conf_*_1.yml)

### Current Status

- Created simplified test version that's easier to debug
- Provided properly formatted configuration files in both script directory and standard location
- Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose ongoing connectivity issues
- Fixed path handling errors in configuration loading

### Next Steps

1. Test simplified strategy with paper trading
2. Resolve any connectivity issues with exchange servers
3. Gradually reintroduce advanced features once basic functionality is confirmed
4. Optimize API calls to prevent rate limit issues
5. Implement proper backtesting
