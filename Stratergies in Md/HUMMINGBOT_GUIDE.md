## 3. Understanding Hummingbot Architecture

Hummingbot is structured with the following key components:
- **Connectors**: Interface with exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).
- **Strategies**: Script-based trading logic (e.g., Pure Market Making, Adaptive Market Making).
- **Configurations**: Modular config files to adjust trading parameters.
- **Data Feeds**: Real-time and historical data streams for live trading and backtesting.
- **Risk Management**: Built-in features for limiting exposure, managing inventory, and safeguarding capital.

## 4. Deep Dive: Adaptive Market Making Strategy

### 4.1 Configuration Overview

The Adaptive Market Making strategy is configured via `AdaptiveMarketMakingConfigMap`, located at `hummingbot/conf/adaptive_market_making_config.py`. Key configuration parameters include:

- **connector_name**: The exchange connector (default: `binance_paper_trade`).
- **trading_pair**: The trading pair to use (default: `ETH-USDT`).
- **order_amount**: The size of each order (default: `0.01`).
- **min_spread** and **max_spread**: The bounds for order spread (default: `0.001` and `0.01` respectively).
- **order_refresh_time**: How frequently orders are refreshed (default: `15.0` seconds).
- **max_order_age**: Maximum age of an order before it is refreshed (default: `300.0` seconds).

#### Technical Indicator Parameters:
- **rsi_length**: The period for the RSI indicator (default: `14`).
- **rsi_overbought**: RSI threshold for overbought market conditions (default: `70.0`).
- **rsi_oversold**: RSI threshold for oversold market conditions (default: `30.0`).

The file also includes validation methods (e.g., `validate_rsi_thresholds`) to ensure your configurations maintain logical consistency.

### 4.2 How It Works

The strategy works by:

- **Collecting Market Data**: Obtaining real-time price updates and historical data.
- **Calculating Technical Indicators**: Such as RSI and EMA to gauge market conditions.
- **Dynamic Order Placement**: Adjusting bid/ask spreads based on market indicators and pre-set configurations.
- **Risk Management**: Enforcing limits on order age, spread boundaries, and other risk parameters to mitigate losses.

## 5. Running Your Strategy

### 5.1 Live Trading

To start live trading with the Adaptive Market Making Strategy:

```bash
python hummingbot/scripts/adaptive_market_making.py
```

This script will:
- Initialize your strategy with the parameters specified in `adaptive_market_making_config.py`.
- Connect to your chosen exchange (e.g., binance_paper_trade).
- Begin placing and refreshing orders automatically.
- Log trading activity and performance metrics (e.g., PnL, order execution details).

### 5.2 Backtesting

For backtesting, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Historical Data**: Ensure you have a source of historical price data (candlestick data).

2. **Run the Backtesting Script**:

```bash
python hummingbot/scripts/backtest_strategy.py
```

The backtesting script will:
- Load historical market data for your given trading pair.
- Feed the data into the strategy as if it were live.
- Generate performance metrics such as total PnL, win rate, and maximum drawdown.

3. **Analyze the Results**: Observe outputs such as:
   - Number of trades executed
   - Profit and loss (PnL)
   - Performance ratios (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, drawdown percentages)

## 6. Advanced Configuration & Tuning

### 6.1 Customizing Strategy Parameters

You can adjust your strategy's behavior by modifying the values in `adaptive_market_making_config.py`. For example, to adjust RSI thresholds, locate the following in your configuration:

```python
rsi_overbought: float = Field(70.0, ...)
rsi_oversold: float = Field(30.0, ...)
```

Update these values as required by your analysis.

### 6.2 Integrating Additional Indicators

The strategy is modular, so you can integrate additional technical indicators or machine learning models. Use helper functions in `hummingbot/util/indicators.py` or extend classes in the strategy module.

### 6.3 Monitoring and Logging

Real-time logs provide insights into strategy performance. Ensure you monitor console output or use logging frameworks integrated into Hummingbot to track:
- Order placement and refresh events
- Indicator calculations
- Performance metrics
