# Archive Documentation

This folder contains files that were considered redundant, experimental, or not necessary for the main Hummingbot custom market-making strategy assignment.

## Archived Files

### Scripts

- **precision_trading_clean.py**: 
  - Early version of the precision trading strategy with a similar structure to precision_trading_clean1.py.
  - Archived because it was merged with precision_trading_clean1.py to create the final precision_trading.py.
  - This version used binance_paper_trade as the default exchange.

- **precision_trading_clean1.py**:
  - Almost identical to precision_trading_clean.py with minor differences.
  - Archived because it was merged with precision_trading_clean.py to create the final precision_trading.py.
  - This version used binance as the default exchange.

### Differences from Final Scripts

The final implementation in `strategies/precision_trading.py` contains several improvements over these archived versions:

1. **Configuration Loading**: The final version loads configuration from a YAML file rather than hardcoded values.
2. **Error Handling**: Improved try/except blocks and logging throughout the code.
3. **Modularization**: Better modularization of functions and cleaner code structure.
4. **Indicator Calculation**: More comprehensive technical indicator calculations with better data management.
5. **Order Sizing**: Enhanced dynamic order sizing based on inventory management.
6. **Signal Generation**: Improved weighted signal generation system across multiple timeframes.

## Why These Files Were Archived

These files were archived rather than deleted to maintain a history of the development process and to provide a reference for how the final strategy evolved. They represent earlier iterations of the strategy that were functional but have been superseded by the more comprehensive versions in the `strategies/` directory.

If you need to reference any of the specific implementations or approaches used in these earlier versions, they are preserved here for historical purposes.
