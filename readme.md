# Adaptive Market Making Strategy: End-to-End Implementation Guide

## 1. Problem Statement and Requirements

### Overview
This guide addresses the BITS GOA take-home assignment to design and develop a custom market making strategy for cryptocurrency exchanges using the Hummingbot framework. The task requires creating a sophisticated market-making solution that incorporates:
- Volatility indicators
- Trend analysis 
- Risk framework for inventory management

The strategy must improve upon the basic Pure Market Making (PMM) algorithm by adding advanced technical analysis, multi-timeframe confirmation, machine learning integration, and comprehensive risk management.

### Key Requirements
- Implement a script using Hummingbot's `ScriptStrategyBase`
- Incorporate technical indicators for market analysis

## 3. Understanding Pure Market Making

### Core Concepts
Market making involves:
- Providing liquidity to markets by placing limit orders on both sides
- Earning profits from the bid-ask spread
- Managing inventory to maintain balanced exposure
- Adjusting parameters based on market conditions

### Analysis of Demo Scripts

#### PMMCandles (1.py)
```python
# Key components:
# - Basic bid/ask spread (fixed)
# - Order refresh mechanism
# - Candles data integration
# - Simple order creation/cancellation
```
Limitations:
- Fixed spreads regardless of market conditions
- No inventory management
- No technical analysis for decision making
- No risk management

#### PMMInventoryShift (2.py)
```python
# Key improvements:
# - Dynamic spreads based on NATR (volatility)
# - Price shifts based on RSI (trend)
# - Inventory ratio adjustment
# - Enhanced status display
```
Limitations:
- Single timeframe analysis
- Limited technical indicators
- Basic inventory management
- No machine learning integration

# **Institutional Crypto Trading Framework**  
## **1. Smart Weighting System (Adaptive Points Matrix)**

### **Dynamic Indicator Weights**  
*Weights adjust based on market volatility (ATR-based):*

| Indicator | Short-Term (1-5D) | Medium-Term (1-4W) | Long-Term (1-6M) | Volatility Adjustment |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **RSI**   | 18-22             | 14-16              | 8-12              | +5% in low volatility|
| **MACD**  | 22-25             | 24-28              | 18-22             | +10% in trends       |
| **EMA50** | 12-15             | 18-22              | 24-28             | +15% at key levels   |
| **BBands**| 14-18             | 12-16              | 8-12              | +20% during squeeze  |
| **Vol+Candle**| 20-24         | 16-18              | 14-16             | +30% with 2x volume  |
| **S/R**   | 8-10              | 10-12              | 20-24             | +50% at major zones  |

**Threshold Formula:**  
`Entry Score = Σ(Indicator Weights) + Timeframe Bonus + Volume Multiplier`

```bash
# Deployment Options
$ cryo-strat deploy --network mainnet \
    --risk-profile [high|medium|low] \
    --timeframe [short|medium|long] \
    --liquidity-source "binance,okex,bybit"
```


# **Precision Algorithmic Trading Strategy with Weighted Indicators**  
**(Optimized for Crypto Markets)**  

This strategy assigns **weighted scores** to each indicator and combines them to generate **high-probability buy/sell signals** based on **risk tolerance** (High/Medium/Low) and **time horizon** (Short/Medium/Long-term).  

---

## **1. Indicator Weighting System (0-100 Points)**
Each indicator is assigned a **weight** based on its reliability in different market conditions. A **minimum threshold score** must be crossed for a valid signal.

### **Core Indicators & Weights**  
| Indicator | Weight (Short-Term) | Weight (Medium-Term) | Weight (Long-Term) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **RSI (30/70 Crossover)** | 20 | 15 | 10 |
| **MACD Crossover** | 20 | 25 | 20 |
| **50 EMA Break** | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **Bollinger Band Squeeze + Break** | 15 | 15 | 10 |
| **Volume Spike + Candlestick** | 20 | 15 | 15 |
| **Support/Resistance Break** | 10 | 10 | 20 |

**Minimum Threshold for Entry:**  
- **Short-Term:** ≥ **70/100**  
- **Medium-Term:** ≥ **75/100**  
- **Long-Term:** ≥ **80/100**  

*(Higher thresholds reduce false signals but may delay entries.)*  

---

## **2. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation (Primary + Secondary Chart)**
To increase signal accuracy, we use **two timeframes** for confirmation:  

| Trader Type | Primary Chart | Secondary Chart |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Short-Term (1-5 days)** | 1H | 15M |
| **Medium-Term (1-4 weeks)** | 4H | 1H |
| **Long-Term (1-6 months)** | Daily | 4H |

**Rules:**  
- Signal must appear in **both timeframes** (but weights differ).  
- Secondary chart adds **+10% confidence** if aligned.  

---

## **3. Refined Entry & Exit Conditions (Combination Rules)**
### **A. Strong Buy Signal (Must Have 3+ Confirmed Factors)**
1. **RSI:** Crosses **above 30** (with divergence = +5 points)  
2. **MACD:** Bullish crossover **+ above zero line** = +10 points  
3. **50 EMA:** Price breaks **above EMA** with **volume spike** = +15 points  
4. **Bollinger Bands:** Price bounces off **lower band** + squeeze = +10 points  
5. **Candlestick:** **Hammer/Bullish Engulfing** + volume = +15 points  
6. **Support/Resistance:** Strong bounce at **key support** = +10 points  

**Example (Short-Term Buy):**  
- RSI (20) + MACD (20) + EMA Break (15) = **55**  
- Add **Candlestick (15)** + **Volume (10)** = **80/100 (Valid Entry)**  

### **B. Strong Sell Signal (Must Have 3+ Confirmed Factors)**
1. **RSI:** Crosses **below 70** (with divergence = +5 points)  
2. **MACD:** Bearish crossover **+ below zero line** = +10 points  
3. **50 EMA:** Price breaks **below EMA** with **volume spike** = +15 points  
4. **Bollinger Bands:** Price rejects **upper band** + squeeze = +10 points  
5. **Candlestick:** **Shooting Star/Bearish Engulfing** + volume = +15 points  
6. **Support/Resistance:** Rejection at **key resistance** = +10 points  

**Example (Medium-Term Sell):**  
- MACD (25) + EMA Break (20) + Candlestick (15) = **60**  
- Add **RSI (15)** + **Volume (10)** = **85/100 (Valid Exit)**  

---

## **4. Risk Management (Per Trader Type)**
### **A. High-Risk Traders (Aggressive)**
- **Stop-Loss:** 3-5% (Trailing after 10% profit)  
- **Take-Profit:** 15-25% (Partial exits at 10%, 15%, 20%)  
- **Position Size:** 8-10% per trade  
- **Leverage (Optional):** 2-3x (Only for short-term trades)  

### **B. Medium-Risk Traders (Balanced)**
- **Stop-Loss:** 5-7% (Trailing after 8% profit)  
- **Take-Profit:** 10-15% (Partial exits at 7%, 12%)  
- **Position Size:** 3-5% per trade  
- **Leverage:** Avoid or 1-2x (Only for high-confidence setups)  

### **C. Low-Risk Traders (Conservative)**
- **Stop-Loss:** 8-10% (Trailing after 5% profit)  
- **Take-Profit:** 8-12% (No leverage, only spot)  
- **Position Size:** 1-2% per trade  
- **Only Enters:** High-weight (≥80/100) signals  

---

## **5. Special Cases (Bull/Bear Traps & Fakeouts)**
To avoid traps, **additional confirmation** is required:  

### **A. Bull Trap Avoidance (False Breakout)**
- If price breaks **above resistance** but:  
  - **Volume is declining** (-10 points)  
  - **RSI shows divergence** (-5 points)  
  - **MACD is weakening** (-5 points)  
  → **Avoid entry or short with tight SL**  

### **B. Bear Trap Avoidance (False Breakdown)**
- If price breaks **below support** but:  
  - **Volume spike is missing** (-10 points)  
  - **RSI is oversold but not reversing** (-5 points)  
  - **Candles show long wicks** (+5 points for reversal)  
  → **Wait for confirmation or go long with tight SL**  

---

## **6. Machine Learning Enhancement (Next Phase)**
### **A. LSTM Model for Signal Confirmation**
- **Input:** Historical OHLCV + Indicator values  
- **Output:** Probability score (0-1) for trend continuation/reversal  
- **Hybrid Approach:**  
  - If ML model confidence > **70%**, increase position size by **20%**.  
  - If ML model confidence < **50%**, reduce position size by **50%**.  

### **B. Random Forest for Feature Importance**
- Helps **adjust weights dynamically** (e.g., if MACD is more reliable in trending markets, increase its weight).  

---

## **Final Summary: Precision Trading Rules**
| Scenario | Action | Confirmation Needed |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **RSI + MACD + EMA Break** | Strong Buy | Add Volume Spike |
| **Bollinger Squeeze + Candlestick** | Breakout Trade | Check Volume |
| **Support Bounce + Hammer** | Reversal Buy | MACD Turning Up |
| **Resistance Rejection + RSI Divergence** | Strong Sell | EMA Break Down |
| **Low Volume Breakout** | Avoid/Fade | Wait for Retest |

### **Best Combo for High-Probability Signals**
✅ **Short-Term:** RSI + MACD + Candlestick + Volume  
✅ **Medium-Term:** EMA + MACD + Bollinger Bands  
✅ **Long-Term:** Support/Resistance + EMA + Volume  

This **weighted, multi-timeframe** approach ensures **high-probability entries** while minimizing false signals. The **risk management rules** adapt to different trader profiles, making it **market-ready for crypto trading**.  

Would you like a **backtesting template** (Python/Pine Script) to validate this strategy? 🚀



when the rsi goes below 30 mark line it is considered stock is ovesold in a shorter period of time and when it cuts the 30 mark line from below, it is genrally  considered stock is bottomed and started its reversal and usually a buy signal. Similarly when the RSI does the exact oppostite in the other end and moves above 70 mark and has starts revrsing and cuts the 70 mark line from above, it is genrally considered that the stock has topped and started revrsal and is usually a sell signal. Trend reversal can also be detected by looking at whether the RSI is making higher highs higher lows even when stock is going down, an d same viceversa

Coming to MACD indicator, when MACD line cuts the signal line from below it is generally considered a buy signal and when MACD line cuts signal from above, it is generally considered sell signal.

In the daily chart, if the stock cuts the 50 day exponentila moving average (EMA) from below it is considered bullish and even untill and unless the stock go's below it, it is still oncsidered bullish, and when the stock cuts the EMA from above, it is considered bearish and is generally a sell signal

Coming to Bollinger Bands with MA special indicator, when the bands compress i.r it becomes small around the stock price line, then it means that the stock is mostly sideways and looking for a direction to move, it can be up or down depending whether the stock starts touching the upper mart of the bollinger band aggressievly, it means the start is likely to push upwards out of the accumulartion phase and viceversa when it starts touching lower bolinger bands. This push in a certain direction is confirmed by looking at the volume, when the volume is higher than average when it starts finding direction, it usually means the trend will move in that direction.

When coming to resistance and support levels. Support Levels:
Areas where a stock price stops falling and bounces upward
Formed when buyers consistently enter the market at a specific price level
Often seen as horizontal lines connecting price lows
Resistance Levels:
Areas where a stock price stops rising and reverses downward
Created when sellers consistently enter the market at a specific price level
Often seen as horizontal lines connecting price highs
Usually when stocks starts feeling resistance moving downwards at previous support levels in the charts, it genmerally cionsidered a good time to enter the market and similarly when the stock feels resistance moving upwrads around previous resitance levels, it usully means it a good time to reduce your allocation.

Now coming to candle stick analysis, hammer candle stick in the downtrend followed by a green candle with more than average volume is usually a bottom signal and change in trend and same happens when u see a reverse hammer in the uptrend followed by a red candle with good volume. This is also true for bullish engulfing supported by volume and bearush engulfing.

Coming to bull trap and bear trap, this usually heppens around support and resistance levels, when stock moves below the suport level for like 3 or 5% so that the stop losses are strikked of retail investors and suddendly bulls take control of the fall and buy at lower prices and buy at lower prices, this is reffered to as bear trap, and vice versa is called bull trap when bears gives fake signal of bullisha and trap bulls by pushing a stock down after it crosses above resistance levels. 

Coming to stoploss, we can keep a variable stopless wherein we maximize the profits along with mitigating losses, for example, keep 5% stop loss and when price moves up by 10%, then the stoploss level also moves by 10% and still the stoploss is at 5% below the current prices. This makes sure that when stock moves upwards and starts falling dur to trend reversla, you can book profits along with mitigating losses, if the stocks moves 5% below.

# **Precision Algorithmic Trading Strategy with Weighted Indicators**  
**(Optimized for Crypto Markets)**  

This strategy assigns **weighted scores** to each indicator and combines them to generate **high-probability buy/sell signals** based on **risk tolerance** (High/Medium/Low) and **time horizon** (Short/Medium/Long-term).  

---

## **1. Indicator Weighting System (0-100 Points)**
Each indicator is assigned a **weight** based on its reliability in different market conditions. A **minimum threshold score** must be crossed for a valid signal.

### **Core Indicators & Weights**  
| Indicator | Weight (Short-Term) | Weight (Medium-Term) | Weight (Long-Term) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **RSI (30/70 Crossover)** | 20 | 15 | 10 |
| **MACD Crossover** | 20 | 25 | 20 |
| **50 EMA Break** | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **Bollinger Band Squeeze + Break** | 15 | 15 | 10 |
| **Volume Spike + Candlestick** | 20 | 15 | 15 |
| **Support/Resistance Break** | 10 | 10 | 20 |

**Minimum Threshold for Entry:**  
- **Short-Term:** ≥ **70/100**  
- **Medium-Term:** ≥ **75/100**  
- **Long-Term:** ≥ **80/100**  

*(Higher thresholds reduce false signals but may delay entries.)*  

---

## **2. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation (Primary + Secondary Chart)**
To increase signal accuracy, we use **two timeframes** for confirmation:  

| Trader Type | Primary Chart | Secondary Chart |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Short-Term (1-5 days)** | 1H | 15M |
| **Medium-Term (1-4 weeks)** | 4H | 1H |
| **Long-Term (1-6 months)** | Daily | 4H |

**Rules:**  
- Signal must appear in **both timeframes** (but weights differ).  
- Secondary chart adds **+10% confidence** if aligned.  

---

## **3. Refined Entry & Exit Conditions (Combination Rules)**
### **A. Strong Buy Signal (Must Have 3+ Confirmed Factors)**
1. **RSI:** Crosses **above 30** (with divergence = +5 points)  
2. **MACD:** Bullish crossover **+ above zero line** = +10 points  
3. **50 EMA:** Price breaks **above EMA** with **volume spike** = +15 points  
4. **Bollinger Bands:** Price bounces off **lower band** + squeeze = +10 points  
5. **Candlestick:** **Hammer/Bullish Engulfing** + volume = +15 points  
6. **Support/Resistance:** Strong bounce at **key support** = +10 points  

**Example (Short-Term Buy):**  
- RSI (20) + MACD (20) + EMA Break (15) = **55**  
- Add **Candlestick (15)** + **Volume (10)** = **80/100 (Valid Entry)**  

### **B. Strong Sell Signal (Must Have 3+ Confirmed Factors)**
1. **RSI:** Crosses **below 70** (with divergence = +5 points)  
2. **MACD:** Bearish crossover **+ below zero line** = +10 points  
3. **50 EMA:** Price breaks **below EMA** with **volume spike** = +15 points  
4. **Bollinger Bands:** Price rejects **upper band** + squeeze = +10 points  
5. **Candlestick:** **Shooting Star/Bearish Engulfing** + volume = +15 points  
6. **Support/Resistance:** Rejection at **key resistance** = +10 points  

**Example (Medium-Term Sell):**  
- MACD (25) + EMA Break (20) + Candlestick (15) = **60**  
- Add **RSI (15)** + **Volume (10)** = **85/100 (Valid Exit)**  

---

## **4. Risk Management (Per Trader Type)**
### **A. High-Risk Traders (Aggressive)**
- **Stop-Loss:** 3-5% (Trailing after 10% profit)  
- **Take-Profit:** 15-25% (Partial exits at 10%, 15%, 20%)  
- **Position Size:** 8-10% per trade  
- **Leverage (Optional):** 2-3x (Only for short-term trades)  

### **B. Medium-Risk Traders (Balanced)**
- **Stop-Loss:** 5-7% (Trailing after 8% profit)  
- **Take-Profit:** 10-15% (Partial exits at 7%, 12%)  
- **Position Size:** 3-5% per trade  
- **Leverage:** Avoid or 1-2x (Only for high-confidence setups)  

### **C. Low-Risk Traders (Conservative)**
- **Stop-Loss:** 8-10% (Trailing after 5% profit)  
- **Take-Profit:** 8-12% (No leverage, only spot)  
- **Position Size:** 1-2% per trade  
- **Only Enters:** High-weight (≥80/100) signals  

---

## **5. Special Cases (Bull/Bear Traps & Fakeouts)**
To avoid traps, **additional confirmation** is required:  

### **A. Bull Trap Avoidance (False Breakout)**
- If price breaks **above resistance** but:  
  - **Volume is declining** (-10 points)  
  - **RSI shows divergence** (-5 points)  
  - **MACD is weakening** (-5 points)  
  → **Avoid entry or short with tight SL**  

### **B. Bear Trap Avoidance (False Breakdown)**
- If price breaks **below support** but:  
  - **Volume spike is missing** (-10 points)  
  - **RSI is oversold but not reversing** (-5 points)  
  - **Candles show long wicks** (+5 points for reversal)  
  → **Wait for confirmation or go long with tight SL**  

---

## **6. Machine Learning Enhancement (Next Phase)**
### **A. LSTM Model for Signal Confirmation**
- **Input:** Historical OHLCV + Indicator values  
- **Output:** Probability score (0-1) for trend continuation/reversal  
- **Hybrid Approach:**  
  - If ML model confidence > **70%**, increase position size by **20%**.  
  - If ML model confidence < **50%**, reduce position size by **50%**.  

### **B. Random Forest for Feature Importance**
- Helps **adjust weights dynamically** (e.g., if MACD is more reliable in trending markets, increase its weight).  

---

## **Final Summary: Precision Trading Rules**
| Scenario | Action | Confirmation Needed |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **RSI + MACD + EMA Break** | Strong Buy | Add Volume Spike |
| **Bollinger Squeeze + Candlestick** | Breakout Trade | Check Volume |
| **Support Bounce + Hammer** | Reversal Buy | MACD Turning Up |
| **Resistance Rejection + RSI Divergence** | Strong Sell | EMA Break Down |
| **Low Volume Breakout** | Avoid/Fade | Wait for Retest |

### **Best Combo for High-Probability Signals**
✅ **Short-Term:** RSI + MACD + Candlestick + Volume  
✅ **Medium-Term:** EMA + MACD + Bollinger Bands  
✅ **Long-Term:** Support/Resistance + EMA + Volume  

This **weighted, multi-timeframe** approach ensures **high-probability entries** while minimizing false signals. The **risk management rules** adapt to different trader profiles, making it **market-ready for crypto trading**.  

Would you like a **backtesting template** (Python/Pine Script) to validate this strategy? 🚀



when the rsi goes below 30 mark line it is considered stock is ovesold in a shorter period of time and when it cuts the 30 mark line from below, it is genrally  considered stock is bottomed and started its reversal and usually a buy signal. Similarly when the RSI does the exact oppostite in the other end and moves above 70 mark and has starts revrsing and cuts the 70 mark line from above, it is genrally considered that the stock has topped and started revrsal and is usually a sell signal. Trend reversal can also be detected by looking at whether the RSI is making higher highs higher lows even when stock is going down, an d same viceversa

Coming to MACD indicator, when MACD line cuts the signal line from below it is generally considered a buy signal and when MACD line cuts signal from above, it is generally considered sell signal.

In the daily chart, if the stock cuts the 50 day exponentila moving average (EMA) from below it is considered bullish and even untill and unless the stock go's below it, it is still oncsidered bullish, and when the stock cuts the EMA from above, it is considered bearish and is generally a sell signal

Coming to Bollinger Bands with MA special indicator, when the bands compress i.r it becomes small around the stock price line, then it means that the stock is mostly sideways and looking for a direction to move, it can be up or down depending whether the stock starts touching the upper mart of the bollinger band aggressievly, it means the start is likely to push upwards out of the accumulartion phase and viceversa when it starts touching lower bolinger bands. This push in a certain direction is confirmed by looking at the volume, when the volume is higher than average when it starts finding direction, it usually means the trend will move in that direction.

When coming to resistance and support levels. Support Levels:
Areas where a stock price stops falling and bounces upward
Formed when buyers consistently enter the market at a specific price level
Often seen as horizontal lines connecting price lows
Resistance Levels:
Areas where a stock price stops rising and reverses downward
Created when sellers consistently enter the market at a specific price level
Often seen as horizontal lines connecting price highs
Usually when stocks starts feeling resistance moving downwards at previous support levels in the charts, it genmerally cionsidered a good time to enter the market and similarly when the stock feels resistance moving upwrads around previous resitance levels, it usully means it a good time to reduce your allocation.

Now coming to candle stick analysis, hammer candle stick in the downtrend followed by a green candle with more than average volume is usually a bottom signal and change in trend and same happens when u see a reverse hammer in the uptrend followed by a red candle with good volume. This is also true for bullish engulfing supported by volume and bearush engulfing.

Coming to bull trap and bear trap, this usually heppens around support and resistance levels, when stock moves below the suport level for like 3 or 5% so that the stop losses are strikked of retail investors and suddendly bulls take control of the fall and buy at lower prices and buy at lower prices, this is reffered to as bear trap, and vice versa is called bull trap when bears gives fake signal of bullisha and trap bulls by pushing a stock down after it crosses above resistance levels. 

Coming to stoploss, we can keep a variable stopless wherein we maximize the profits along with mitigating losses, for example, keep 5% stop loss and when price moves up by 10%, then the stoploss level also moves by 10% and still the stoploss is at 5% below the current prices. This makes sure that when stock moves upwards and starts falling dur to trend reversla, you can book profits along with mitigating losses, if the stocks moves 5% below.


### Technical Indicator Framework

The Adaptive Market Making Strategy employs a weighted scoring system across different timeframes:

| Indicator | Short-Term Weight | Medium-Term Weight | Long-Term Weight |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| RSI | 20 | 15 | 10 |
| MACD | 20 | 25 | 20 |
| EMA50 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| Bollinger Bands | 15 | 15 | 10 |
| Volume Analysis | 20 | 15 | 15 |
| Support/Resistance | 10 | 10 | 20 |

#### Indicator Calculations

**RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
```python
def calculate_rsi(self, prices, length=14):
    """Calculate RSI technical indicator"""
    delta = np.diff(prices)
    gain = np.where(delta > 0, delta, 0)
    loss = np.where(delta < 0, -delta, 0)
    
    avg_gain = np.mean(gain[:length])
    avg_loss = np.mean(loss[:length])
    
    for i in range(length, len(delta)):
        avg_gain = (avg_gain * (length - 1) + gain[i]) / length
        avg_loss = (avg_loss * (length - 1) + loss[i]) / length
        
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss if avg_loss != 0 else 100
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi
```

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
```python
def calculate_macd(self, prices, fast_length=12, slow_length=26, signal_length=9):
    """Calculate MACD technical indicator"""
    fast_ema = self.calculate_ema(prices, fast_length)
    slow_ema = self.calculate_ema(prices, slow_length)
    macd_line = fast_ema - slow_ema
    signal_line = self.calculate_ema(macd_line, signal_length)
    histogram = macd_line - signal_line
    return macd_line, signal_line, histogram
```

**Bollinger Bands with Kalman Filter**
```python
def calculate_bollinger_bands_enhanced(self, prices, high_prices, low_prices, close_prices, volumes, length=20, num_std=2.0):
    """Calculate Bollinger Bands with Kalman filter enhancement"""
    # Apply Kalman filter to smooth price data
    filtered_prices = self.apply_kalman_filter(prices)
    
    # Calculate moving average and standard deviation
    rolling_mean = np.convolve(filtered_prices, np.ones(length)/length, mode='valid')
    rolling_mean = np.concatenate([np.array([rolling_mean[0]] * (length-1)), rolling_mean])
    
    rolling_std = np.array([np.std(filtered_prices[max(0, i-length+1):i+1]) for i in range(len(filtered_prices))])
    
    # Calculate bands
    upper_band = rolling_mean + (rolling_std * num_std)
    lower_band = rolling_mean - (rolling_std * num_std)
    
    # Detect crossovers
    crossover = np.zeros(len(prices))
    crossunder = np.zeros(len(prices))
    
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > upper_band[i] and prices[i-1] <= upper_band[i-1]:
            crossover[i] = 1
        if prices[i] < lower_band[i] and prices[i-1] >= lower_band[i-1]:
            crossunder[i] = 1
    
    return upper_band, rolling_mean, lower_band, crossover, crossunder
```

### Multi-Timeframe Confirmation System

The strategy analyzes multiple timeframes with different weights:
- Primary timeframe (1h): 60% weight - Main decision-making
- Secondary timeframe (15m/4h): 30% weight - Confirmation
- Tertiary timeframe (1d): 10% weight - Trend filtering

```python
def collect_multi_timeframe_data(self):
    """Collect data from multiple timeframes and store in dictionary"""
    timeframes = {
        self.primary_timeframe: 0.6,  # 60% weight
        self.secondary_timeframe: 0.3,  # 30% weight
        self.tertiary_timeframe: 0.1  # 10% weight
    }
    
    multi_tf_data = {}
    for tf, weight in timeframes.items():
        candles = self.get_candles_for_timeframe(tf)
        if candles is not None and len(candles) > 0:
            multi_tf_data[tf] = {
                'candles': candles,
                'weight': weight
            }
    
    return multi_tf_data
```

### Market Regime Detection

The strategy uses statistical methods and machine learning to classify market regimes:

```python
def detect_market_regime(self, prices, volumes, window_size=100):
    """
    Detect market regime (trending, ranging, volatile) based on price behavior
    
    Returns:
        dict: Contains regime type, confidence, and trend direction
    """
    if len(prices) < window_size:
        return {"regime": "unknown", "confidence": 0.0, "trend_direction": 0}
        
    # Calculate volatility
    returns = np.diff(prices) / prices[:-1]
    volatility = np.std(returns) * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized
    
    # Check for trend using linear regression
    x = np.arange(len(prices[-window_size:]))
    y = prices[-window_size:]
    slope, _, r_value, _, _ = scipy.stats.linregress(x, y)
    
    # Determine regime
    if volatility > 0.05:  # High volatility
        if abs(r_value) > 0.7:  # Strong trend
            regime = "trending_volatile"
            confidence = abs(r_value) * 0.8 + volatility * 4
            trend_direction = 1 if slope > 0 else -1
        else:
            regime = "volatile"
            confidence = volatility * 10
            trend_direction = 0
    else:  # Lower volatility
        if abs(r_value) > 0.7:  # Strong trend
            regime = "trending"
            confidence = abs(r_value)
            trend_direction = 1 if slope > 0 else -1
        else:
            regime = "ranging"
            confidence = 1 - abs(r_value)
            trend_direction = 0
            
    return {
        "regime": regime,
        "confidence": min(1.0, confidence),
        "trend_direction": trend_direction
    }
```

### Risk Management Framework

The strategy implements comprehensive risk controls:

**Dynamic Position Sizing**
```python
def calculate_order_amounts(self):
    """
    Calculate buy and sell order amounts based on:
    - Account balance
    - Inventory position
    - Market conditions
    - Signal strength
    """
    base_balance = self.connectors[self.exchange].get_balance(self.base_asset)
    quote_balance = self.connectors[self.exchange].get_balance(self.quote_asset)
    mid_price = self.get_mid_price()
    
    # Convert balances to common unit
    base_value = base_balance * mid_price
    total_value = base_value + quote_balance
    
    # Calculate inventory ratio
    current_ratio = float(base_value / total_value) if total_value > 0 else 0.5
    inventory_deviation = self.target_inventory_ratio - current_ratio
    
    # Adjust for market regime
    regime = self._market_regime.get("regime", "unknown")
    if regime == "volatile":
        # Reduce position size in volatile markets
        size_scalar = 0.7
    elif regime == "trending":
        # Increase size when trend is detected in direction of order
        trend_direction = self._market_regime.get("trend_direction", 0)
        size_scalar = 1.2 if (trend_direction > 0 and inventory_deviation < 0) or \
                           (trend_direction < 0 and inventory_deviation > 0) else 1.0
    else:
        size_scalar = 1.0
    
    # Apply signal strength adjustment
    signal_scalar = 0.5 + (min(1.0, self._total_score / 100) * 0.5)
    
    # Calculate base amount
    base_amount = float(self.order_amount) * size_scalar * signal_scalar
    
    # Adjust buy/sell amounts based on inventory position
    buy_amount = base_amount * (1.0 + min(1.0, inventory_deviation * 2))
    sell_amount = base_amount * (1.0 - min(1.0, inventory_deviation * 2))
    
    # Ensure minimum sizes
    buy_amount = max(self.min_order_amount, buy_amount)
    sell_amount = max(self.min_order_amount, sell_amount)
    
    return Decimal(str(buy_amount)), Decimal(str(sell_amount))
```

**Trailing Stop Implementation**
```python
def check_trailing_stops(self):
    """Check if any trailing stops are triggered"""
    if not self._trailing_stops:
        return
        
    current_price = self.get_mid_price()
    stops_to_execute = []
    
    for order_id, stop_data in self._trailing_stops.items():
        if stop_data["type"] == "BUY":
            # Update the highest seen price
            if current_price > stop_data["highest_price"]:
                stop_data["highest_price"] = current_price
                # Move the trailing stop up
                stop_data["current_stop"] = current_price * (1 - float(self.trailing_stop_pct))
            
            # Check if stop is triggered
            if current_price < stop_data["current_stop"]:
                stops_to_execute.append((order_id, stop_data))
                
        else:  # SELL
            # Update the lowest seen price
            if current_price < stop_data["lowest_price"]:
                stop_data["lowest_price"] = current_price
                # Move the trailing stop down
                stop_data["current_stop"] = current_price * (1 + float(self.trailing_stop_pct))
            
            # Check if stop is triggered
            if current_price > stop_data["current_stop"]:
                stops_to_execute.append((order_id, stop_data))
    
    # Execute stops
    for order_id, stop_data in stops_to_execute:
        self.execute_stop(order_id, stop_data)

## 10. Financial Theory

### Market Making Fundamentals

Market making involves:
- Providing liquidity by placing limit orders on both sides of the order book
- Earning the bid-ask spread as compensation for liquidity provision
- Managing inventory risk to prevent excessive exposure
- Adjusting spreads based on volatility and market conditions

Key principles:
- Wider spreads during high volatility periods
- Tighter spreads in stable markets
- Dynamic position sizing based on market conditions
- Inventory management to maintain balanced exposure

### Technical Analysis Foundation

The strategy employs multiple technical indicators, each serving a specific purpose:

- **RSI**: Measures momentum and identifies overbought/oversold conditions
- **MACD**: Identifies trend direction and strength
- **EMA**: Provides trend direction and potential support/resistance levels
- **Bollinger Bands**: Measures volatility and potential price extremes
- **Volume Analysis**: Confirms price movements and identifies potential reversals
- **Support/Resistance**: Identifies key price levels where supply and demand balance

The weights for these indicators vary by timeframe because:
- Short-term traders rely more on momentum indicators (RSI, Volume)
- Medium-term traders focus on trend indicators (MACD, EMA)
- Long-term traders emphasize structural indicators (Support/Resistance, EMA)

### Market Regimes

Markets typically exhibit three main regimes:
1. **Trending**: Directional price movement with momentum
2. **Ranging**: Oscillation between support and resistance levels
3. **Volatile**: Rapid price changes with increased uncertainty

Each regime requires different trading approaches:
- Trending markets: Tighter spreads in trend direction
- Ranging markets: Wider spreads at range extremes
- Volatile markets: Increased spreads, reduced position sizes

## 11. Conclusion and Future Enhancements
